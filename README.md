# Hello, world

I primarily do web development with Python, JS/TS, and PostgreSQL,
though I have also been working in Rust on side projects for the last 5 years and
have recently done a little work in Go, as well.

I have a few side projects that I split my (limited) free time between,
the more interesting (to me) of which can be found at [crude computer](https://github.com/crudecomputer).
