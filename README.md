# Hello, world

I have been a full-stack web developer for the past 9 years, primarily working with Python, JS/TS
(from plain JS or jQuery to Ember, React, or Vue depending on the project), and PostgreSQL.
Previously, as an intern architect and even before, I had some experience making websites from scratch,
managing Wordpress sites (and writing PHP), and scripting with Python and AutoLISP. And for the past 5 years
or so, I have been getting more and more into Rust and, to a smaller extent, Go for web servers & CLI tools.

For most of my career I have been either employed at (full-time) or embedded in (as a consultant) small companies,
and those are the environments in which I most thrive. The more hats I need to wear the happier I am, from
meeting with product owners or users to determine the direction of a feature or product to building out UIs,
APIs, and managing CI/CD pipelines (in particular Gitlab/Github Actions) and infrastructure (typically on AWS but with some experience on GCP).

I have a few side projects that I split my (very limited) free time between, most of which are private but 
the more interesting (to me) public ones can be found at [crude computer](https://github.com/crudecomputer).
