# Hello, world

I have been a full-stack web developer for the past 9 years, primarily working with Python, JS/TS
(from plain JS or jQuery to Ember, React, or Vue depending on the project), and PostgreSQL.
Most of my career has been either employed (full-time) or embedded (as a consultant) in small companies,
and those are the environments in which I most thrive, because the more hats I need to wear the happier I am.

Previously, as an intern architect and even before, I had some experience making websites from scratch,
managing Wordpress sites (and writing PHP), and scripting with Python and AutoLISP. And for the past 5 years
or so, I have been getting more and more into Rust and Go for web servers & CLI tools.

I have a few side projects that I split my (limited) free time between, most of which are private but 
the more interesting (to me) public ones can be found at [crude computer](https://github.com/crudecomputer).
