# About Me

I am a product-focused, full-stack software engineer with 10 years of full-time experience
and 15 years of tinkering before that.

My primary languages are **Python** (with type annotations) and **JavaScript/TypeScript**,
though I am also quite comfortable working with **Rust** and, to a lesser extend, **Go**.
Favorite technologies include **PostgreSQL**, because it is powerful!

For most of my career, I have been employed at or, as a consultant, embedded in smaller companies,
which is where I most thrive. The more hats I need to wear the happier I am, from meeting with product owners
or users to determine the direction of a feature or product to building out UIs/APIs,
improving developer experience on projects, creating CI/CD pipelines (in particular Gitlab/Github Actions),
and managing infrastructure (typically via **Terraform** on AWS but with some experience on GCP).

I have a few side projects that I split my (very limited) free time between, most of which are private - 
the more interesting (to me) public ones can be found at [crude computer](https://github.com/crudecomputer).
